# UNC-Charlotte-Research-Connect
UNC Charlotte has a vast collection of research/data that has accumulated over the course of time. Every year, students and faculty members add new studies and data to the collection. Currently, there is no method of sorting and viewing researchers on their topics. 
Created a website that amalgamates, summarizes, and organizes the topics present in this huge body of research according to each researcher, which includes the topics they researched as well as their interests and capabilities. Website uses web scraping to collect data from various UNC Charlotte websites (e.g. Atkins, CCI, etc.) and create a visualization of the data for each researcher. Additionally, a web scraping bot that frequently updates with new data was created for updating data
